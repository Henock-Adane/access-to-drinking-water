# Access to Drinking Water Project 🌍💧

## Overview
This is an ongoing data analysis project focused on understanding global disparities in access to drinking water. The work combines data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and **now includes significant data transformation to analyze trends and make projections.**

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Identify patterns in water service access (basic, limited, unimproved, surface).
- Analyze differences across rural, urban, and national levels.
- Understand the impact of income level on access to clean water.
- Provide a foundation for deeper modeling and dashboard reporting.
- **Calculate Annual Rates of Change (ARC) for national, rural, and urban water access.**
- **Investigate and project future water access trends based on historical ARCs.**
- **Analyze water access dynamics by area and region, identifying progress and challenges.**

## 📊 Key Visuals
- **Access by Region** – Compares water access levels across rural, urban, and national aggregates.
- **Income vs Access** – Shows correlation between income group and access to water types.
- **National Distribution** – Highlights the proportion of populations using each type of water service.
- **Year Distribution Histogram** - Visualizes the frequency of data collection years in the dataset.
- **ARC Difference (Rural vs. Urban) Histogram** - Displays the distribution of the difference in Annual Rates of Change between rural and urban areas.
- **National vs. Rural ARC Scatter Plot** - Shows the relationship between national and rural Annual Rates of Change, categorized by region (color) and national population size (point size).
- **Water Access Projection Line Chart** - Illustrates historical basic water access trends and projects future access based on calculated Annual Rates of Change.
